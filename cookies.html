<p>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</p>
<p>1 large egg, room temperature</p>
<p >1 Tablespoon vanilla extract</p>
<p>2 cups all purpose flour</p>

<p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1/4 cup rainbow sprinkles</p>

<td><p>1.Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.</p>
<p>2.In a stand mixer fit with the whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</p>
<p>3.Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl, adding the egg and the vanilla extract. Beat until light and fluffy and pale in color.</p>
<p>4.Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and beat until just combined and no streaks of flour remain. Do not overmix. Add the sprinkles and turn the mixer on quickly to distribute the sprinkles. Try not to mix the dough much or this will cause the sprinkles to break.</p>
<p>5.Use a 1 ounce cookie scoop to scoop the dough into 1 inch balls, dropping them onto your cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake for 11 minutes or until the cookies are just set on the edges, but still very gooey in the middle. This will keep your cookies super soft. Allow the cookies to cool for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Enjoy!</p>

<td>
<p>1.Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease or line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.</p>
<p>2.In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, cream butter and brown sugar on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add in the egg, vanilla extract, and salt and beat 1 minute more.</p>
<p>3.Turn mixer to low and mix in the cocoa, flour, and baking soda, mixing until just combined.</p>
<p>4.Use a 1/2 oz cookie scoop (or use a 1 oz cookie scoop and divide the dough in half) to scoop balls of dough. Roll each ball between palms to form a perfect circle, then place on prepared baking sheet.</p> 
<p>5.Bake for 7 minutes, then remove from heat and allow cookies to cool on baking sheets until they reach room temperature.</p>
<p>6.To make the buttercream, beat the butter, sugar, peppermint extract and milk until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in the candy cane pieces until just combined. Place frosting into a piping bag with a medium tip.</p>
<p>7.Pipe roughly 1 tablespoon of frosting onto half of the cookies, then sandwich with remaining cookies. Drizzle with chocolate and top with crushed up candy canes! Keep refrigerated. Will last up to 5 days in the fridge.</p>

        <td>
<p>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</p>
<p>1 cup granulated sugar + more for coating the cookies</p>
<p>1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>1 teaspoon ginger</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon cloves</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1/2 cup crisco, melted</p>
<p>1 egg</p>
<p>1/4 cup molasses</p>
<p>3/4 cup old fashioned oats</p>
</td>


<td><p>1.Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.</p>
<p>2.In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, ginger, cloves, and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the melted and cooled crisco and egg. Stir well. The dough will crumbly. You’re doing it right.</p>
<p>3.Pour in the molasses and oats and stir everything together until combined.</p>
<p>4.Use a large cookie scoop to make tennis ball sized dough balls, placing them 3 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheet.</p>
<p>5.Now it’s time to flatten out the cookies. Grab two small bowls and fill one with water and one with granulated sugar. Take a flat bottomed glass, dipping the bottom of the glass in the water and then the sugar. 
<p>6.Press the sugar coated bottom firmly into the dough ball to flatten it out, leaving behind a thick sugar coating on top of the cookie. This will give the cookies their signature crunch.</p>
<p>7.Repeat for the rest of the cookies. Bake at 375°F until the edges are golden brown and the centers have puffed up, but are still raw in the middle, about 11 minutes for us.</p>
<p>8.Allow cookies to sit for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool. Enjoy!</p>

<p>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>11 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</p>
<p>2/3 cup (packed) light brown sugar</p>
<p>1/4 cup sugar</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p>
<p>3/4 cup mini chocolate chips</p>
<p>10 oz dark chocolate, chopped</p>
<p>1 tablespoon coconut oil</p>
<p>1/2 cup pistachios, chopped</p>
</td>

<td><p>1.Sift the flour, cocoa and baking soda together. Set aside.</p>

<p>2.Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy.</p>

<p>3.Turn off the mixer. Pour in the dry ingredients, drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and your kitchen from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. </p>

<p>4.Toss in the chocolate pieces, and mix only to incorporate. Turn the dough out onto a work surface, gather it together and divide it in half. Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>5.Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325ºF. Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.</p>

<p>6.Using a sharp thin knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch thick. (The rounds are likely to crack as you’re cutting them — don’t be concerned, just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie.) </p>

<p>7.Microwave the chopped dark chocolate and coconut oil in 20 second increments until fully melted. Sprinkle immediately with chopped pistachios and drizzle the remaining chocolate over the cookies.</p>

<p>5.Roll the balls first in the granulated sugar and then in the powdered sugar to completely coat the cookie balls. Place on the prepared cookie sheet an inch apart. </p>
<p>6.Bake for 10 minutes or until the cookies have puffed up and cracked, but are still a little gooey in the center. Allow to cool and enjoy with a glass of milk!</p>
