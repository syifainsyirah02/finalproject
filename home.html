<p id="nak_justify">This blog is handle by myself, Syifa. My goal with this blog is to give you the fun, laughter, confidence and knowledge to bake and cook whatever you fancy! I’ve been running this blog since November 2020, and thankfully it’s still going strong!</p>

<p id="nak_justify">The Yummy Tummy baking blog that I have made comes with diverse recipe expertise. This baking blog may definitely help bring new ideas for preparing cakes, cupcakes, and cookies to baking enthusiasts. Yummy Tummy baking blog can also help beginner students who want to try the field of baking because I've provide a video of easy-to-follow recipes and how to design cakes.</p>

<p id="nak_justify">Yummy Tummy loves to research recipes daily, and experiment, so I hope you like the results! Yummy Tummy also tries recipes from Celebrity Chef’s, other Food Bloggers, and just recipes that come across whether in a magazine, or on the internet! Some experimentations don’t work quite so well, but others work truly brilliantly and have amazing feedback from Yummy Tummy's trusty taste testers. Baking and Cooking is all about Science and Chemistry at the end of the day, and I love it.</p>
