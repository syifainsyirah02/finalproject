    <p>1¼ cups all-purpose flour</p>
    <p>1¾ cups granulated sugar</p>
    <p>2½ teaspoons baking powder</p>
    <p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>

<p>5 cups powdered sugar</p>
<p>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</p>
<p>Rainbow sprinkles
(for decorating)</p>
  

</td>
<td><p> 1.Make the Cupcakes: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cupcake pan with paper liners; set aside.</p>

<p> 2.In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flours, sugar, baking powder and salt, and mix together on low speed for 1 minute. With the mixer on low, add the butter, a few cubes at a time, continuing until all the butter has been added and the mixture resembles coarse sand.</p>

<p> 3.Keeping the mixer on low speed, add the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl between additions. Slowly pour in the milk and vanilla and mix until combined. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes, until batter is smooth, scraping the sides of bowl as needed. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir in the sprinkles.</p>

<p> 4.Fill the liners two-thirds full (about ¼ cup of batter) and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the centers are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.</p>

<p> 5.Make the Frosting: Using the wire whisk attachment of your stand mixer, whip the butter on medium-high speed for 5 minutes, stopping to scrape the bowl once or twice. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the powdered sugar.</p>

<p> 6.Frost the cupcakes as desired (I used the Ateco #808 decorating tip) and garnish with additional sprinkles. Frosted cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
