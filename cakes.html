<p>1.Prepare the vanilla cake according to directions. Pour into 3 greased 6 inch rounds* and bake at 350°F for 30 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out mostly clean. Set aside to chill.</p>
<p>2.While the cakes cool, prepare the filling. Prepare the caramel according to directions. Set aside 1/2 cup of the caramel to
use for drizzling the top of the cake. Add the chopped pecans to the remaining 1 1/2 cups of caramel and stir to combine.</p>
<p>3.To make the buttercream, beat the butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt, and beat to combine. Scrape down the bowl and beat for 2 minutes until light and fluffy.</p>
<p>4.To assemble the cake, place the first layer on a cake stand or flat plate. Pipe about half of the caramel praline filling around the cake. Place the second layer on top of the filling and repeat with the remaining half of the filling.</p>
<p>5.Frost the cake with the cream cheese frosting, covering the top and pulling down to cover the sides of the cake. Put the cake in the fridge to chill for 15 minutes. This will help the frosting and filling to set.</p>
<p>5.While the cake is chilling warm up the remaining 1/2 cup of caramel in a microwave safe bowl. Pour over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Top the top of the cake with crushed up pecans. Enjoy!</p>

        <td>
<p>for the cake, 1/2 cup vegetable oil</p>
<p>1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</p>
<p>2 Tablespoons lemon zest (about 1 lemon worth of zest)</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</p>
<p> 4 eggs, room temperature</p>
<p>1 1/3 cups buttermilk*</p>
<p>2 teaspoons lemon extract</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p>2 2/3 cup all purpose flour</p>
<p>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p>

<p>1/4 teaspoon Stonemill Ground Ginger</p>
<p>1 cup Nature’s Nectar Apple Cider</p>

<p>for the frosting:</p>
<p>1/2 cup butter</p>
<p>4 oz cream cheese</p>
<p>3 1/2 cups powdered sugar</p>


<td><p>1.Preheat the oven to 325°F and grease and flour three 6 inch cake pans or two 8 or 9 inch cake pans. Set aside.</p>
<p>2.Combine the sugar and the lemon zest in a small bowl and rub the lemon zest into the sugar with your fingers to infuse the sugar. Set aside.</p>
<p>3.Slowly add the granulated sugar to the oil and butter, beating on high until the mixture is light and fluffy and turns a very pale yellow, about 3 minutes.</p>
<p>4.Add the eggs in one at time, scraping down the bowl in between each addition. Add the lemon extract and the vanilla extract. Beat the mixture on high for 3 minutes more to incorporate as much air as possible.</p>
<p>5.In separate bowl sift together the cake flour, salt, and baking powder. Alternate mixing in the dry ingredients and the buttermilk in 4 batches, starting with the buttermilk and ending with the dry ingredients. It’s okay if the batter still has a few lumps in it–you don’t want to over mix it.</p>
<p>6.Split the batter evenly into the prepared pans and bake for 30 minutes or until the cake is a lightly golden brown and springs back when pressed. This will depend on your oven. Take out of the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Let the cakes cool completely.</p>
<p>7.If making dehydrated lemons, use a sharp knife to thinly slice 2 lemons. Preheat the oven to 300°F and line two sheet pans with parchment paper. Place the lemon slices a few inches apart on the prepared pans and sprinkle with granulated sugar.</p>

</td>
        <td> 
<p>1.Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and line three 6″ cake pans with parchment paper.</p>
<p>2.In a large bowl, mix together sugar, coconut oil, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract.</p>
<p>3.In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, and salt. Carefully fold dry ingredients into wet until mostly combined.</p>
<p>4.Fold in carrots and shredded coconut. Distribute batter evenly into prepared pans (1 1/3 cups of batter per pan).</p>
<p>5.Bake for 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before frosting.</p>
<p>6.Make the caramel while the cake is baking. In a medium saucepan, heat the sugar on medium-low heat for about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to occasionally stir the sugar, getting to the bottom of the pan.</p>
<p>7.Once the sugar is fully melted and turns a medium gold hue, remove from heat immediately and stir in butter. The mixture will violently bubble. Use your spatula to stir the butter and sugar until they melt together completely.</p>
<p>8.To make frosting, whip butter and cream cheese in a standing mixer on high speed for 1 minute. Lower speed and add in powdered sugar, ginger, salt, and vanilla extract, mixing until combined.</p>
<p>9. Add remaining frosting to sides of cake, then use a cake scraper or flat cake knife to smooth frosting out around edges.
Pour caramel around outside crown of the cake, using a fork to help pull drippy bits down the cake. SERVE!</p>
